      				<p style="margin-bottom: 300px; width: 900px;">I am Andrew Krodinger. I grew up not knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I joined the United States Marine Corps to try and figure that out. I was a 0651 Data Network Specialist, the civilian equivalent of a systems administrator. I spent four years dedicated to bettering myself, training my brothers in arms, and serving my country. I would not trade the experience for anything in the world. Being a systems administrator got me interested in computing in general. I realized quickly that I like to create versus deploying or managing networks. Once I received my Honorable Discharge I immediately began to seek out top tier Computer Science Degrees. I landed at CU Boulder and its up and coming CS department. They offered a re-vamped class structure that had classes on new current technologies. I enjoyed my time at CU. It was a great environment to really seek out what you were interested in and try and further yourself or complete a project in said area. While I was an undergraduate I was able to hold a position at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), first in the IT department, and then in the Mission Operations and Data Structures Department. I worked on retrieving data from current satellite missions and editing the data structures that were currently in place to make them quicker, faster, and all around better. I also created web plugins to offer new functionality to our database software. I did a large QA project, implementing MGUnit - an IDL testing framework - across development and legacy code. I felt a great sense of pride working as LASP. I was directly involved with things that were going on in space a million miles away from me, and I always found that fascinating. I will be graduating from CU in the summer of 2016, and I will be looking for similar jobs to what I am currently doing now. I enjoy flight/drones, working with scientist and other professionals, and the sense of pride you get from creating something that is useful and could inevitably help change the world.</p>

						<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">I hope you enjoyed getting to know me. I became a Marine to change who I was. For me the change was good, but others were less fortunate. 6.5% of Americans are Veterans. Of that total many suffer from the effects of war. I have seen The Wounded Warrior Project in operation first hand and the work they provide is essential for many of the veterans they service. Their mission is to foster the most successful, well-adjusted generation of wounded service members in our nation's history.
